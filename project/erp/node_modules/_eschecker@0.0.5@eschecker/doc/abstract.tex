The popularity of JavaScript dramatically increased over the last years. It evolved from the programming language of the web to a general purpose language that is also used for mobile-,  desktop- and server-applications. However, the tooling support for program verification is spare due to the dynamic nature of JavaScript that is hard to be covered using static analysis. The existing verification tools are either limited to simple bug patterns, are based on a super or subset of JavaScript, or only support outdated JavaScript versions. This work describes an  algorithm for type inference and type checking of JavaScript code written in strict mode. The defined algorithm combines the Hindley-Milner Algorithm W with abstract interpretation. The type system used by the algorithm is unsound as the precision of the type inference degrades for very dynamic code, code that is mainly located in frameworks or libraries. The defined algorithm is implemented in \textit{ESChecker} and is compared to competitive type checkers.  The results show that a precise type inference can be achieved for a majority of programs and type checking provides a valuable feedback for programmers.

/**
 * Hindley Milner algorithm implementation that infers all the types for a ast node and all it's children.
 * The Hindley Milner algorithm uses a set of rules that perform the refinement. By default, the refinement rules
 * are loaded from the './refinement-rules' directory. Each rule must default export the Rule-Class.
 * In all cases only one rule is allowed to match a node. If more then one rule matches a node, then an error is thrown.
 *
 * The implementation expects that {@link #infer} is called for each statement in the AST. The implementation
 * does not traverse the ast nodes, it does only infer the types on a statement basis (e.g. it infers the types
 * in the test condition of the if statement but it does not infer the types in the consequent and the alternative branch).
